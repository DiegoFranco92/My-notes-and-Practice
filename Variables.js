//VARIABLES are ways to asign value to things.
// we use them to save some value inside a "name"
var name = "Diego"; //now the variable "name" has the string "Diego" inside.

//types of VARIABLES var, let and const
var pet = "Nina"; 
let race = "pomeranian";
const sex = "female";

// "var" can be change any time for a new value
var pet = "suri"; // now the var "pet" has a new value = "suri"
// it also can be change with out the variable:
pet = "pepita";

//if we dont what this to happend we use the "const" variable
const PI = 3.1416; // we use "const" for values that we know there not going to change.

//"let" is a blok scope variable. it works as "var" but its value is only defined inside functions. 
for (let i = 0; i< 10; i++) {}  //in this for loop. "i" is defined as 0. but it will only work inside this loop

//VARIABLES can hold any tyme of DATA TYPE
